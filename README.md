# Stock Dashboard

Local stock-summary dashboard. No backend, no build step — just PowerShell + a static HTML/JS template.

## Files

- `Update-StockDashboard.ps1` — fetches live quotes (Yahoo Finance chart API, no key), recent
  headlines (Google News RSS, no key), quarterly financials + analyst consensus (Naver Finance,
  no key) for the tickers listed in `watchlist.json`, then renders `template.html` into
  `dashboard.html`.
- `watchlist.json` — the ticker list. Only `"Symbol"` is required.
- `template.html` — the dashboard UI: per-card 1M/3M/6M/1Y range toggle + 20/60일 이동평균선,
  sparkline with hover tooltip, a "최근 이슈" news list (real article titles/links, not
  AI-written summaries), 실적/목표주가 popups, portfolio P&L tracker (localStorage only).
- `run.bat` — double-click launcher (bypasses PowerShell execution-policy prompts).
- `dashboard.html` — generated output, opened automatically after each run. Not tracked in git.
- `email-summary.html` / `email-subject.txt` — generated daily email body/subject (price + top
  2 headlines per ticker, golden/dead cross tags). Written every run for local preview; actually
  *sending* it only happens in the GitHub Actions workflow. Not tracked in git.

## Usage

Double-click `run.bat`, or:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File Update-StockDashboard.ps1
```

### Adding a ticker

Add a line to `watchlist.json` — only `Symbol` is required, e.g.:

```json
{ "Symbol": "AAPL" }
```

Everything else (display name, market label, news search term, 실적/목표주가 source) is
auto-derived from the symbol: `.KS` → KOSPI, `.KQ` → KOSDAQ, `^` prefix → index, anything else
is assumed NASDAQ. Add an explicit `"DisplayName"`, `"NewsQuery"`, `"MarketLabel"`, or
`"FinanceCode"` in the same entry to override any of those. NYSE tickers need an explicit
`"FinanceCode": "SYMBOL.N"` since the auto-default assumes NASDAQ (`SYMBOL.O`).

Browser-side "add a ticker from the dashboard" isn't possible — Yahoo Finance and Naver's APIs
both block direct cross-origin requests from a browser (CORS), which is why this project fetches
data with a PowerShell script instead of client-side JS in the first place.

## Notes

- Requires only Windows PowerShell 5.1 — no Python/Node/npm.
- `.ps1` files must stay saved as **UTF-8 with BOM**, or Windows PowerShell 5.1 misreads the
  Korean text and the ₩ sign and fails to parse the script.

## Email summary (GitHub Actions only)

The daily workflow (`.github/workflows/update-dashboard.yml`) emails `email-summary.html` to
`jhyupkim@unid.co.kr` via Gmail SMTP after each run. One-time setup, done outside this repo:

1. On the sending Gmail account, turn on 2-Step Verification, then generate an App Password at
   [myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).
2. In the repo: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**, add:
   - `GMAIL_USERNAME` — the sending Gmail address
   - `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` — the 16-character app password from step 1
3. To change the recipient, edit the `to:` line in the workflow's "Send email summary" step.

Local runs (`run.bat`) still generate `email-summary.html` for preview but never send it — only
the Actions workflow has the secrets, and CI-only sending is intentional so testing locally
doesn't spam the inbox.
